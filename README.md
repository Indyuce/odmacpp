# ODMAC++ Communication Manager

Source code of ODMAC++ simulations

## Description

Java source code is available in the `src` folder. All Python scripts used to study data generated by the simulations
and plot useful graphs are located in the `python` folder.

## Use Guide

- Run `Main` and let the simulations run
- Simulation output files are placed inside of the `output` folder
- Open up `plot_data.ipynb` in the `python` folder to plot simulation graphs

## Possible improvements

- ~~rewrite energy module~~
- multiple sinks, forwarding mechanism from original ODMAC
- less homogenous system: different energy exposure coefficients, different battery sizes.
- ~~energy cycle (period of energy time evolution) is known by all devices.... in theory, it's not true, and there are
  mult~~
- ~~improve the model of the energy cycle, over a longer time => not only days, but seasons. mainly two periods, 24h and
  365d~~ not needed, this is what buffers are for.
- ~~energy cycle is supposed to be provided... but there could be a module to predict it with a fast fourier
  transform????~~ same as previous
