### Possible improvements

=> a lot of improvements possible in the model. in reality the model of the environment could be a little more homogeneous

- rassifier la gestion des modèles d'énergie
- multiple sinks
- energy cycle (period of energy time evolution) is known by all devices.... in theory, it's not true, and there are mult
- improve the model of the energy cycle, over a longer time => not only days, but seasons. mainly two periods, 24h and 365d
- energy cycle is supposed to be provided... but there could be a module to predict it with a fast fourier transform????
- sensors get the same energy at any time, maybe model the fact that some sensors are placed at some places where they don't get as much sun (shadows, walls etc)
